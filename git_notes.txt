What is Git?
Git is a popular version control system. 
It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, and has been maintained by Junio Hamano since then.

Used for:

 - Tracking code changes
 - Tracking who made changes
 - Coding collaboration

What does Git do?
 - Manage projects with Repositories
 - Clone a project to work on a local copy
 - Control and track changes with Staging and Committing
 - Branch and Merge to allow for work on different parts and versions of a project
 - Pull the latest version of the project to a local copy
 - Push local updates to the main project

Working with Git
 - Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository
 - Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder
 - When a file is changed, added or deleted, it is considered modified
 - You select the modified files you want to Stage
 - The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files
 - Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.
 - You can revert back to any previous commit.
 - Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!

Why Git?
 - Over 70% of developers use Git!
 - Developers can work together from anywhere in the world.
 - Developers can see the full history of the project.
 - Developers can revert to earlier versions of a project.

What is GitHub?
 - Git is not the same as GitHub.
 - GitHub makes tools that use Git.
 - GitHub is the largest host of source code in the world, and has been owned by Microsoft since 2018.
 - In this tutorial, we will focus on using Git with GitHub.
